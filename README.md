## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
The goal of this project is to build a Java-based control and visualization layer for the SUMO traffic simulator using the libtraci interface.  
Milestone 1 focuses on establishing the project foundation through architecture design, component planning, and the demonstration of a working SUMO integration.

### 1.2 System Description
The system provides a communication pipeline between Java 21 and SUMO 1.25.0 via libtraci.  
This enables the application to load SUMO configurations, start and control simulations programmatically, inspect traffic entities, and later visualize them through a GUI.

Milestone 1 establishes:
- Portable SUMO integration
- Working Java ↔ libtraci ↔ SUMO communication
- Basic simulation control (load config, step execution)
- Architecture design for future GUI, logic, and analytics modules
- Mockups and class structure for upcoming milestones
- Repository setup and technical documentation
